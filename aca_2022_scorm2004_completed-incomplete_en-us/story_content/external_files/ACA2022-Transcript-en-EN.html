	<h2>Recognize Phishing Attacks </h2>
	<div>
		When people use emotion, urgency, or incentives such as telling you, "your bank account has been compromised" or "you got a gift card", it is likely phishing. 
		<br><br>
		Here's the situation: You're about to head to work. You put on your gloves and jacket, take and badge, and exit the door of your home. As you're leaving, you receive a text and see a weird link in the text. Here are some security tips to follow:
		<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Phishing tries to get you to share confidential information, like passwords or credit card numbers.
				</li>
				<li>
				Hover or focus over links before clicking. If you don’t recognize the site or it looks suspicious, don’t click. Links and attachments in phishing emails can have information-gathering malware. On a mobile device, hold your finger down over the link and it will preview.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Reduce Physical Security Risks </h2>
	<div>
		Here's the situation:  You're at work, and a co-worker requests you to badge them in since they've forgotten their work badge. Here are some security tips to follow:
		<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Always wear your badge on company grounds and avoid wearing them in public places.
				</li>
				<li>
				Don't use your badge or credentials to grant access for others.
				</li>
				<li>
				If you see someone without a badge, remind them to display it.
				</li>
				<li>
				Always check that your working environment is physically safe and protected.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
	</div>

	<h2>Using Company Resources</h2>
	<div>
		Here’s the situation: You're at your desk and open your computer to start work. You see an instant chat notification from your co-worker. You see that your co-worker wants you to send business plans to their personal email because they can't access their work email. Here are some security tips to follow: 
		<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Only use your company email for work needs. Don't send company data to external email addresses.
				</li>
				<li>
				Use company computers only for business and limited personal use. Don't use company's intellectual property for personal use. 
				</li>
				<li>
				Keep your work and personal devices' software up-to-date. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
	</div>

	<h2>Protect Information and Data</h2>
	<div>
		Here's the situation: You're about to head to a meeting. You print a confidential document and take it with you to the meeting. During the meeting, you discuss the confidential document while your co-worker writes confidential data on the writing board. Here are some security tips to follow:
		<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Don't print confidential documents unless needed. Don't share them with others if they don't have a need to know. Use cross-cutting shredders to safely dispose of them at home or in the office.
				</li>
				<li>
				Wipe all writing boards after using the meeting rooms and remove or shred any printed documents.
				</li>
				<li>
				Don't discuss confidential work topics in public places. Someone could hear your conversation.
				</li>
				<li>
				Always lock your work computer when you step away - even at home.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
	</div>

		<br><br>
			<ul>

				Be aware of data privacy. Data privacy involves the rights and duties of individuals and organizations regarding the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal data. Personal data is information that can be linked to a person.
				</li>
				<li>
				If you process personal data, know the privacy risks. Processing of personal data includes collecting, retrieving, using, disclosing, sharing, and erasing personal data.

				</li>
				<li>
				Write down as much as you can about the incident (phone number, name, the website referenced) and report it to your security team. 
				</li>
			</ul>
