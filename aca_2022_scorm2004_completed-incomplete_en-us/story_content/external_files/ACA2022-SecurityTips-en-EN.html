				Phishing tries to get you to accidentally reveal confidential information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
				</li>
				<li>
				Hover/focus over URLs before clicking links. If you don't recognize the site or it looks suspicious, don't click. Links and attachments in phishing emails can contain information-gathering malware. To do this on a mobile device, hold your finger down over the link and it will preview.
